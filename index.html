		  <p>Happy Birthday, Mika!

	In the past few months we've been friends, my whole world felt lighter because of you and you radiate so much positivity and kindness to everyone! You think about others, you're talented, artistic, open-minded, and just an overall caring person to your loved ones. I thank this day from 19 years ago that you were born because without you, honestly what's the point of existing. I'm so glad you exist and I can't wait to explore more days of my college or even outside school with you! Happy Birthday, Mika!</p>

		  <p>Hi Mika, happy happy 19th birthday!! I hope youâ€™ve been doing well with your acads and everything. Whatever projects youâ€™re working on for school, Iâ€™m wishing you good luck and that youâ€™ll be successful!. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re having a hard time, but just know that if youâ€™re struggling, I hope youâ€™ll be able to persevere through! After all, Iâ€™m really excited to see all the cool game stuff you can make hehe.

	Thanks so much for being such a long-time friend of mine. Itâ€™s really crazy to just look back and see how weâ€™ve both grown and changed over the past years. Just remember, even if we donâ€™t keep in touch as much as we used to, that doesnâ€™t make our friendship any less valuable. Youâ€™re still a really dear friend to me, and Iâ€™m always open to spending time with you! So donâ€™t feel shy to come to me and talk about whatever.

	Happy birthday again, hope u have the best day !!!! And see u tomorrow ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

		  <p>Happy birthday mika!!! 
	I hope you have an amazing birthday! It hasn't been too long since we met through idv but it feels like it's been forever already. 
	I'm so glad that we met each other because playing valorant or playing with you in general is so much fun and you make the games so much more bearable and enjoyable. When you're around it's always good and positive energy in the air. You introducing me to luxiem alongside Kc really helped me through the pandemic so I'm so glad that we knew each other during that time because it made my life sooo much better throughout the pandemic. I'm also happy that I have someone to play fps with even if it's just mostly valo.
	 I hope that you keep being authentically yourself, I hope that you'll always enjoy your current college course, and I hope that your future will be bright.
